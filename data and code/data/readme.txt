2. Folder "test_new" is the combined data of Folder "test" in origin dataset. It is used to do the classification task in our project.

3. Four txt files, file_test_neg.txt, file_test_pos.txt, file_train_pos.txt and file_train_neg.txt, are files containing all the name of reviews¡¯ files. We use them as the link to each review when importing reviews in R.
